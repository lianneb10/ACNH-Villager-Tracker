# User Stories
* As someone that regularly plays ACNH, I want to be able to keep track of which villagers are currently at my island so that I know who I can interact with in-game.
* As a new ACNH players, I want to be able to see all the different villagers in the game so that I can have a goal of who to have on my island when I build out my game.
* As someone that has played the game many times over, I want to have a villager tracking system for myself so that I can see who lived on my previous islands.
